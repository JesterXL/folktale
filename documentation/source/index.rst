Folktale —at a glance—
======================

Folktale is a standard library for functional programming
using TypeScript (although it works just as well in plain
JavaScript, without the type checking). The base Folktale
library provides essential types and functions for writing
programs in any JavaScript environment.

Folktale's design is guided by three main goals: correctness,
simplicity, and compositionality. This documentation should help
understanding the concepts Folktale builds upon and how to best
make use of them in your applications.
